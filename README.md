# Answering Business Questions Using SQL
This project uses visualization to answer business questions about an SQLite database containing record sales data.
Used in a Dataquest course SQL Intermediate: Tables Joins and Relations.

### Packages used
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* SQLite3
* NumPy

Pre-requisites
--------------
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python 2.7, 3.3 +

Getting Started
---------------
Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science [[http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#id3](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#id3)]. 

### Install Anaconda
wget  [https://3230d63b5fc54e62148e-c95ac804525aac4b6dba79b00b39d1d3.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Anaconda-2.3.0-Linux-x86.sh](https://3230d63b5fc54e62148e-c95ac804525aac4b6dba79b00b39d1d3.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Anaconda-2.3.0-Linux-x86.sh)

bash Anaconda-2.3.0-Linux-x86.sh

### OR
If your anaconda does not have Jupyter Notebook, you install via:

### Install Jupyter Notebooks

1.  pip3 install --upgrade pip
2.  pip3 install jupyter (Use pip if using legacy Python 2.)
3.  Done.

### Install Python

1.  Go to  [www.python.org](http://www.python.org/)  and install python 2.x or 3.x
2.  Go to cmd promt and set PATH (e.g. for 2.7)

> setx PATH "c:\Python27"

3.  Open a new cmd instant and type

> python --version

4.  Done.
